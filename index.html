        I discovered Moebius today. Florent's dad is an art collector; there's
        not a single shelf or wall in his house that isn't covered with French
        graphic books or art.

        My flight chased the sun from Paris to LA. We took off at 4 pm in Paris
        and landed shortly before 7 pm at our destination, becoming the longest
        sunset I've ever experienced. An audible gasp when we broke through the
        clouds and the sun, a single yellow shard, embroidered the clouds with
        gold.

        Look how red it is! You have to be quite far up to obtain rays so long,
        so purely and cleanly <i>red</i>, to see the thinnest lip of color.

        A fun day. Jump cut to life in San Francisco, to David and Raffi and

        One of the houses we toured was lived in and decorated by a textile
        artist. The house made plain the meaning of artist, with gently oiled
        floors, olive cushions on amber wood, felted paper and red straw and
        caramel leather.

        I'm in New York. Spent the day with Andrew. He brought me round the East
        side, and then we crossed the bridge to that island. We watched an
        incredibly interesting, low-budget Russian movie from the 90s about
        Russian gangs in the 90s for about 30 mins. Then we had Chinese food
        with Glenn, Katherin (Li), and Andrew.

          Humans, throughout history, have adopted many different tokens and
          forms of exchange. From cowrie shells, to credit ledger systems, to
          bullion, to paper cash, to bits stored on a computer. Money and debt
          are perhaps *the* central organizing aspect of modern societies. So
          much so that hardly anyone knows what it is or where it came from.
          Adam Smith hypothesised that credit systems superceded barter because
          it made trade more efficient. This seems reasonable enough, but that's
          not how it went down historically, the truth is more mysterious.
          Money, is a quantification of what we owe each other in society. And
          yet this doesn't sit well with us, morally speaking. There is a great
          degree of moral confusion surrounding money. <br /><br />
          Here are two quotes, the first is the definition of debt from the
          Oxford english dictionary:<br /><br />
          *debt*. noun 1 a sum of money owed. 2 the state of owing money. 3 a
          feeling of gratitude for a favour or service. <br /><br />
          The second is an American Proverb<br /><br />
          If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If
          you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.
          <br /><br />
          Without further ado, I will now set fire to twenty billion dollars.

      <h1>Saturday Jan 20</h1>
      <p>
        Today the churchbells shook me as they resounded; ringing again and

        Montreal certainly had something to say.
