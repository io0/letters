        I discovered Moebius today. Florent's dad is an art collector; there's
        not a single shelf or wall in his house that isn't covered with French
        graphic books or art.

        My flight chased the sun from Paris to LA. We took off at 4 pm in Paris
        and landed shortly before 7 pm at our destination, becoming the longest
        sunset I've ever experienced. An audible gasp when we broke through the
        clouds and the sun, a single yellow shard, embroidered the clouds with
        gold.

        Look how red it is! You have to be quite far up to obtain rays so long,
        so purely and cleanly <i>red</i>, to see the thinnest lip of color.

        A fun day. Jump cut to life in San Francisco, to David and Raffi and
        caring about neurotech. The sea at the end of the day was most

        Our first sit-down-and-work day. Mackenzie came along, making everything
        more playful. We did a bunch of grants and ops, had the best soup
        dumplings ever, and my spirit felt quite large.

        First party back. It was nice to see people, but also unnerving to see
        them all in the same place — my brain couldn't figure out what shape to
        contort to.

        One of the houses we toured was lived in and decorated by a textile
        artist. The house made plain the meaning of artist, with gently oiled
        floors, olive cushions on amber wood, felted paper and red straw and
        caramel leather.

      <h1>Jan 19 · Friday</h1>
      <p>
        We worked with a new person today. Strangely felt like therapy, someone
        trying to figure out your company and future. At the end, a feeling of
        deep, peaceful exhaustion, of running out of words, a mind having tried
        to do everything in one breath.

      <p>
        A bowl of soup at 10 pm was the perfect ending. Salty, warm, and lemony,
        imbibed in one continuous conscious state.

        Crunchy brain day. We crunched out all our ideas for what to do in the

        ability to reason.

        Spontaneous field trip to Oakland with Aayush. Quality time with Aayush.
        Visited N's warehouse. Wild, stimulating space, but I got the creeps
        from how cynical they were about SF culture — possibly because I'm
        afraid that it's true.

      <p>
        My favorite part of the day was reading papers with Kevin. We read about
        a form of laser speckle imaging which uses the spatial blurring of
        speckles to measure their decorrelation time. Kevin was just radiant
        with curiosity, which inflamed my own.
      </p>

        I haven't yet settled into the institutions of my new life, but I can
        see these Fridays with Kevin becoming one.

        something new. B wants to carve a life-sized marble statue with a robot
        together. M sent me her project and I need to read and provide feedback.
        We're going to build a CW source-detector pair next week. Life is

        We got incorporated today (woot!) and the owner accepted our offer on
        the house.
      </p>
      <h1>Friday, Feb 2</h1>
      <p>
        Consecutive calls from 9 am to 4 pm. Work on neurotech this week has
        been peppered with housing concerns, and my thoughts are constantly cut
        off by housing tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good news: Meta is supporting us by sending some Spotlight fNIRS units
        our way. They've discontinued their efforts in fNIRS, and the lead
        author was just excited to see someone make use of it. It seems like
        they didn't have deep technical reasons for discontinuing the project,
        just that they thought other technologies were easier to go to market
        and more directly relevant to their main interest, silent speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here I could feel a difference in the way we think. The promise of a
        technology is inscribed only by physics; if it's physically possible,
        then it's practically within grasp. How is it that Facebook, with far
        more resources and runway, is the one that's thinking less hard and less
        deeply? A refusal to look past current technology is a refusal to take
        the future seriously.

        The water didn't have to boil and for most people it didn't, but as it

        Many misunderstandings and well-intentioned attempts to make people
        happy, but I just love and care about communities so much that any

      <h1>Friday, March 15</h1>
      a couch appeared, and we were stunned into silence. Beautiful, olive green
      velvet. It was so much a visual gag — camera pan, scene left, couch

      I happened upon my journal entries from December of 2018. The past may as
      well have admitted a patch — I have no recollection of writing these
      entries. They're mundane and unbelievably precious.

          Then there was the buttercream filling. I nearly pissed myself when I
          tasted the buttercream. Ojas and Victor had given it their all, mixing
          chunks of butter into an egg mixture that staunchly rejected the
          butter. I gave it a taste and it tasted like… butter. I was startled
          into laughter. And we had so much of it. We had thrown two entire
          sticks of butter into the mix. I don’t know why Cindy and I had so
          much faith it would turn out ok. We forced Ojas to make beer bread so
          that the butter would go to good use. [...] Eldon came through the
          kitchen and had the beer bread with the butter and asked, “what did
          you do to the butter?” We all started laughing and no one had an
          answer. Because what we did we do? We took butter, whipped it up, and
          made… butter.
        </p>
        <p>
          We made another batch of macarons and ended up with the exact same
          problems as the first. Ojas hooked the whisk up to his drill so that
          we wouldn’t have to spend half an hour beating the egg whites again.

        [Thursday] I landed in Mexico City and all I could do for a while was
        sit out on a concrete bench and wait for my phone to charge. I had
        initially planned to explore the city, then go to Google, but I hit the
        ground and I was in no state to do any exploring. So I went to Google
        first, which was refreshing but for the terrible pain in my back. I left
        at around 4 to see the city, and immediately got on to the wrong bus. At
        this point I was really putting a lot of faith in the 16 pesos in my
        pocket. The first bus was wrong because it was going in the wrong
        direction, but also as I later found out, wrong even if it had been
        going the right direction. [...] I had neither pesos nor USD on me at
        this point. I have become a vagabond, a person liberated from the free
        market. In the end, a nice Mexican man saw that I was looking out of
        place and very kindly paid and got me onto the right bus.

          Humans, throughout history, have adopted many different tokens and
          forms of exchange. From cowrie shells, to credit ledger systems, to
          bullion, to paper cash, to bits stored on a computer. Money and debt
          are perhaps *the* central organizing aspect of modern societies. So
          much so that hardly anyone knows what it is or where it came from.
          Adam Smith hypothesised that credit systems superceded barter because
          it made trade more efficient. This seems reasonable enough, but that's
          not how it went down historically, the truth is more mysterious.
          Money, is a quantification of what we owe each other in society. And
          yet this doesn't sit well with us, morally speaking. There is a great
          degree of moral confusion surrounding money. <br /><br />
          Here are two quotes, the first is the definition of debt from the
          Oxford english dictionary:<br /><br />
          *debt*. noun 1 a sum of money owed. 2 the state of owing money. 3 a
          feeling of gratitude for a favour or service. <br /><br />
          The second is an American Proverb<br /><br />
          If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If
          you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.
          <br /><br />
          Without further ado, I will now set fire to twenty billion dollars.

        Hi. Today I experianced a wide range of emotions after inviting Lucifer

        and saw myself shrink. During this tumult, I applied a lesson from
        Stewart Brand's piece "The Maintenance Race": maintenance cures
        depression. So I did maintained things; I tidied and cleaned and

        Missed opportunities to shoot great pics with the Pentax. <br /><br />

        The first one I missed was a garbage collector making a face as he
        jumped back onto the truck: he puffed up one cheek and let out a sigh of
        brief relief as the truck crossed the road to the other side. He was
        taking a 5 second break in his grueling shedule. <br /><br />

        The second one I missed was a lady with a great mane of frizzly, dark
        brown hair, bouncing in the sunlight as she ran to catch her bus.
        <br /><br />

        The third I missed was a black squirrel facing off with a grey squirrel.
        I got a shot of the black squirrel alone, just a second before the grey
        one challenged him, which is a much lesser picture.

        protesting. I spoke to people on both sides for about 35 mins each. It
        was quite interesting and different experiance on both sides. I tried to
        get them to tell me what they stood for. <br />
        They had two completely different framings of the event. The
        (self-identified) "reformed jewish zionist" I spoke to says he doesn't
        like the Netinyahu govournment and that he doesn't condone unecessary
        violence. He was sober in his countinance but engaged and easy to talk
        to. He sometimes rattled on a bit beyond the point at which all the
        suitable things have been said and the frothy verbiage exiting his mouth
        goes straight into my recycling bin as I think of way in which to stear
        the conversation back onto solid ground. He seemed to have a fairly good
        understanding of the history and was able to explain it to me. <br />
        The palastinian liberation people who were staging this protest were
        shouting slogans that included equating the state of Israel with the KKK
        among other things. The (self-identified) Arab guy I spoke to was much
        harder to speak to. He was reluctant to tell me his views because
        "they're obvious, just look at the facts". Eventually I did work some
        information out of him, but it took alot of work. He used an agressive,
        imperative tone when he told me thing and he made sweeping blanket
        statements without nuance that I had to pick appart. It wasn't
        altogether a pleasant experiance to be yelled at and laughed at and
        intimidated by those standing next to the guy I was engaging with, but I
        was really curious about what they thought and what they were trying to
        accomplish in making such a ruckus. <br />
        I usually walk right past these demonstrations but today, perhaps
        because I had been talking to the councilor, I was curious.

        Shakespear is a genius because he boldly and artfully exposes the
        subtext in the most delicious prose. I wish I were able to reach into
        the web of the emotions that flood my being with life. I wish I could
        lay bare the contents of my soul with both taste and scientific
        precision. Alas, I am a mystery to myself; my notions are blurred and my
        judgement is often clouded.

        "His hair jumping in the barbershop", is how J. D. Salinger opens a
        winding paragraph about his dead brother, who's hair used to jump all
        over him in the barbershop, and how when he pointed this out to him, it
        upset him. I didn't come here to write you about that but I started
        writing and found myself opening with the word-letter "I", which I
        believe to be a testament to how bad my style is. Seymore sallinger was
        a proffessor at NYU by the age of 21 or 22. It's quite a trajic little
        book, actually: "Seymore, an Introduction". We are introduced to the
        author's dead brother and closest alley.

        I awoke from a dream that I was heart-wrenching enough for me to take
        the time to write down, despite the fact that it's 3:30am and I'm still
        tired.<br /><br />

        Orla, Marcel, Charlotte and her faithful friend Clémence, Eliza...<br /><br />

        Here's the backdrop to the dream.<br /><br />

        I had been frequenting a warmly lit and lively but not overcrowded bar,
        alone, to drink alone, and I had been growing weary in my lonliness. As
        if by miracle, my lonliness seemed to conjour some old faces. Members of
        my past came and sat with me as though it were the most natural thing
        for them to do—because it was. They came and they found me drinking
        alone, and they gathered and for a moment I felt together and not alone.
        But as I sat there and tried to explain to them why music was better
        before, and why human expression was freer in the 80's than it is today,
        and how computers were easier to understand and less abstracted, and
        that, if the opportunity presented itsself, I would time-travel back to
        the 90's with all of them and I would be king and I would put them on my
        street on or place them in my court and we would all be equals, together
        with me at the top. But they didn't listen. Those who did engage with me
        brought scepticism to the conversation, they rebuffed me with *what ifs*
        and *buts* and they were unable, or worse, unwilling to glimpse my
        beatific (—my drunken fool's nostalgic) vision of the future past. They
        seemd to fawn obsequiously at the feet of stubborness itsself while I
        lay in a stupified act of worshipping the folly of Dionysus. The more I
        talked the less they listened and the more insufferable I became to them
        and the more intollerable they became to me. They rejected me with their
        their eyes and with their inability to understand my vision, and I grew
        impatiant and I grew frustrated with their stubbornness, and somehow it
        seemed as though they had collueded to disagree with me.<br /><br />

        Really that's what it is, the glue that binds us, approval and
        disapproval, hell is in the other's gaze. Power, this is what drives all
        human affairs. In that moment I knew that Nietzche spoke the
        truth—however he may have intended it—when he said "What is good? All
        that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself.
        What is bad? All that is born of weakness. What is happiness? The
        feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome."<br /><br />

        Power is taken not given, but it is taken in subtle ways. Power is taken
        by the kind and by the generous of spirit, it is forsaken by the
        forsaken and the miserable. Shakespear knew it, Tolstoy knew it, I know
        it.<br /><br />

        I left to "go to the bathroom", but really I just went up to the landing
        above, where a disco was underway. I danced, alone, droopily and sallow
        faced until, failing to attract a partner or to feel enlivened, I gave
        up. Despite being inside this gay, warmly lit wooden bar, rain found me
        sitting alone and isolated, physically and spiritually, from my friends
        forgotten to the past. Time passed and I did nothing to stop the rain
        from streaming down my burning cheeks and dripping from my chin into my
        lap as I gazed at an ill-defined point in space some blurry five-ish
        meters from where I sat.<br /><br />

        Time passed and maronated me in this wet lonliness and I gazed on over
        the edge of the landing until no-one was left in the bar down below. I
        thought they had gone, but when I finally broke out of whatever it was
        that was tantelizing me and fixing my gaze, it was because they, my
        friends, had come and gathered behind me. I wanted to hug and kiss them,
        but lo, the estranged expressions they wore contorted their features
        into a mixture of exhaspiration and pity. I was an ugly sight to them
        and they had come, despite my failur to comply to their worldviews, to
        ...<br /><br />

        They left ahead of me, but Marcel accompanied me a little way. Finally,
        with a look of worn sympathy, he lectured me on<br /><br />
        My journal stops there unfortunately.

      Just back from debate. The debate itself went well, but I'm struggling to find footing among these rosy cheeked milk-drinking teenagers, and alot of them really are teenagers. They're nauseatingly modern. They make me feel like an old man. I was called out today for racial profiling because I talked about Tolstoy to a Russian. <br/><br/>
      In the motion I had to argue in favour of starting a meth business. I made some okay points, but I failed to notice that it was an agent motion, which means that I should have argue more along the lines of why the person described in the rubric might think it's a good idea. I should have argued that he was so washed out that he didn't give a shit. <br/><br/>
      This morning I sent invites to the potluck.
